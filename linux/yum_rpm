YUM AND RPM :- To manage the software in linux ,two utilites are used.
-----------
YUM : yellow dog updater modified.
RPM : Redhat package manager.

RPM :-
----
RPM is a powerful software managementtool for installing ,uninstalling,verifying, querying and updating software packages.
It will not resolve dependencies.

commands :

---->To check all the installed package in the system-----#rpm -qa
     Here q--query
	      a--all

---->To check a particular package is installed or not-----#rpm -qa vsftpd

---->To check a package is consistent or not------#rpm -qa --test

---->To install a package using by rpm command-----#rpm - ivh 
Here 
  i-install
  v-verbose
  h-hashcode

---->To remove a package or uninstalling the package---- #rpm -e
       e---erase

---->To see the information about the package------#rpm -qip

---->To see the information about the installed package-----#rpm -qi

---->To check the package of a particular command-------#which cat
    
	 Even commands are also comming form packages only To check them use
	   1)which cat  /bin/cat --->To check from which location the command is comming
	   2)rpm -qf  /bin/cat---->It will give you from which package we using that command
	   3)if we want to install a package forcefully we need to use this path.

---->To see the configuration files of the installed package------#rpm -qlc 

---->To install a package without installing dependencies------- #rpm -ivh  --nodeps

---->To update a particular package ----- ,#rpm -Uvh 


YUM : (yellowdog updater modified) :
------------------------------------
yum is a powerful software management tool for installing ,uninstalling,verifying, querying and updating software packages.
It will resolve dependencies.

Two configure YUM server there are two ways :-

Repository : It is a place/Area where we are going to store .rpm packages in our (virtual) machine.

1)To configure yum locally :--

     a)Make sure that ISO is connected for virtual machine in settings for (CD/DVD SATA).
	 b)check with  It will show that ISO image mounted on ---->/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64(ISO Image) 
       df -hT---->dev/sr0  mounted on----/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64(ISO Image)
	 c)Then enter into /etc/yum.repos.d 
	 d)create a new file--> vi local.repo
	 
	 [rhel8_AppStream]
	 name=rhel8_AppStream
	 baseurl=file:/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64/AppSteram
	 enabled=1
	 gpgcheck=0
	 
	 [rhel8_BaseOs]
	 name=rhel8_BaseOs
	 baseurl=file:/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64/BaseOs (we need to copy this url from switching the path (/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64/AppSteram (and)/run/media/username/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64/BaseOs)
	 enabled=1
	 gpgcheck=0
	 
	 e)check with-----> yum repolist .(it will show the package details)
	 
	 f)check with package installation With yum ---->yum install vsftpd
	 


===================================================================================================================================
*we have a global server which is having                                                  *
user name and password and connected with                                                  
redhat server i.e satellite                        -------------------------------


====================================================================================================================================

2)To configure YUM server globally :
   
   *check the system is registred with RHN network if not then register.
       ----->subscriction-manager status
	   ------>subscriction-manager register.
	   ----->It will ask for username and password i.e connected to redhat site.\
	   
   *check status of system after regustration.
       ----->subscriction-manager status
   *subscribe the system with redhat network.
       ----->subscriction-manager subscribe
	   
   *clear the cache by using --->yum clean all..
   *update the repository with yum list command.---->yum repolist
   
   
It will show more pacakeges as compared to local repository because it is fetching the data from redhat site directly.

//?Telnet (older way of connection) (port :23):
It is the older way of connectig one server(shell) to other server(shell) and we can we use now as well.
But is not a secure connection between servers in between the connection there is a chance of getting the credentials to
be hacked in between the connection and there is chance that what commands we execute also be know by them.



SSH : secure shell (port :22)
In this connection the first machine encrypts the userid and password and then send to other machine and it will decrypts and 
checks the user name and password and it will helps the user to login to the server.

It uses rsa alogarithm to login to the server to encrypt the userid and password.

It uses a tunneling technique.

server----tunneling----server

we are encrypting the id's from one server and in other server  will be decrypt that user id and password.


configuration file for sshd : cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config :--
------------------------------------------------------

-->open it with vi editor vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

--->search with permit  : like /permit enter

--->it shows -->password authentication is yes (then it will connect from one server to other server with password )

Password less login :
---------------------
Generating ssh key pair : For generating ssh key we need to use command ---->ssh-keygen 
 1)it will generate in (-->cd /root/.ssh)  .
 2)After generating we have two keys i.e, (id_rsa -- private key , id_rsa.pub -- public key)
 3)copy the public key and paste it in the server which you want to login (Ex ssh-copy-id  -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.138.135)
 4)close the sessions in putty and try again .
 5)it will not ask for password.
 
 *** sshd -t ----------> it will show if we have any login errors in the servers.

SCP(secure copy) :
-----------------
1)It is used to copy the data from one server to other server.

Syntax-->scp [options] [source] [destination]

-r: Recursively copy entire directories.
-P port: Specify the port to connect to on the remote host (note the uppercase P).
-p: Preserves the modification times, access times, and modes of the original file.
-q: Suppress the progress meter.
-v: Enable verbose mode for debugging.

*Copy a local file to a remote host:

scp /path/to/local/file user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory

**Copy a file from a remote host to a local machine:

scp user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory

***Copy an entire directory to a remote host:

scp -r /path/to/local/directory user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory

****Copy a file to a specific port on a remote host:

scp -P 2222 /path/to/local/file user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory

*****Copy from one remote host to another:

scp user1@remote_host1:/path/to/file user2@remote_host2:/path/to/destination


   Ensure you have SSH access to the remote host.
   You may be prompted to enter a password for the remote user unless you’ve set up SSH keys for passwordless login.
 
RSYNC(remote syncronised ) command:
---------------------------------
1)It is for backing up of files or directories from one machine other for keeping to machines in sync.
2)In case of scp if the connection losts from one system other then we need to start everything from scratch.
In case of rsync it will not it will start form whereever it has ended.It is design to speed up the copy of two machines.
3)if we use the scp command it will take everything to copy but the rsync command will do whatever we have modified that will
only be synced that when we copied.

-------command :--rsync -rv -e ssh /batch7AM  192.168.195.135:/

here r--recursive
     v--verbose
	 e--ssh 

4)And do some modifications and again and run same command it willl sync only data not files again.

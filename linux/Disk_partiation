Disk Partition and file system:

Partition :

Dividing physical (raw) hardisk into multiple logical(C-Drive,D-drive,E_drive) disk we call it as disk partition.

Why Partition :
Partitioning is a useful strategy for managing disk space, improving performance, securing data, and maintaining a flexible and organized system.
While it can introduce some complexity, the benefits often outweigh the drawbacks, especially in environments where data management and system performance are critical.


Disk partition criteria:

MBR : member boot record(1 sector assume it as a circle)
* bootable files are stored here.

P: primary partition(2nd sector is primary)
*we can create max 3 primary partitions .
with the help of this we can create file systems

Extended partition :(e)
*this is the virtual partition.
*under this we have logical partitions.(L)
*we can create extended partition into logical partitions.we can create 16 logical patiotions

combination is like
3p
2p+1e
1p+1e

Naming convections for disks are like names of the disks i.e sda1,sdb1 etc..

Disk Identification:
EX: /dev/hda ---hard disk.
IDE :Integrated drive electronics. 

/dev/sda --scsi disk
SCSI - small computer system interface.

/dev/vda - virtual drive.

File system :
file system is nothing but storing of data manner in disks.

Types of file systems.

ext2
*it stands for extended secondary file system
*ext2 does not have jounouling feature.
*maximum individulal file size from 16gb to 2 TB.

ext3
*it stands for extended secondary file system
*ext2 does supports jounouling feature.(main feature update)
*maximum individulal file size from 16gb to 2 TB.

ext4
*it stands for extended secondary file system
*ext2 does supports jounouling feature.supports individual file size and overall file system size.
*maximum individulal file size from 16gb to 16 TB.

xfs
*it stands for extension of extended file system. 
*it  supports 64 bit  jounouling file system feature.
*maximum individulal file size starts from 8 exbibytes for 64 bit file system.


**we can convert ex2 to ext3 to ext4 


Mounting :(it is for visiability will craete one dirtectory and will craete file system for that directory)

Attaching a directory or file system in order to access the patition and its file system is know as mounting.

Types of mounting:
We have two types of mounting.
1)cat /etc/fstab--It is called permanant mouting after booting also it will be avalibale.
2)cat /etc/mtab---It is called temperory mouting after booting also it will not be avalibale.

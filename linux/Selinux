SELinux (Security enhanced Linux) : It is security enhance to a linux that allows a user and administrator more control over which user and appalication 
can access rich resources such as standard linux access control file mode are modifable by the users and appalications

2)It is like a policy for systems

3)It is mainly implemented for security.

concepts :
1)SELinux security concepts.
2)Important SELinux configuration files below (Both are same files one soft link is pointing towards both the configuration files)
  a)/etc/sysconfig/selinux
  b)/etc/selinux/config
  
  
b)/etc/selinux/config 
EX:This file controls the state of selinux on the system.
    i)enfororcing :selinux security policy is enforced.
	ii)permissive:selinux prints warning instead of enforceing.
	iii)disabled : No selinux policy is loaded
	
SELinux : It can take one of these two values.
     i)Targeted : Targeted process are protected.
	 ii)mls :multi level security system.

3)modes of SELinux :
  a)Enforcing :
  
  b)Permissive (It is same as debugging mode if we want to debug some thing then it	will be a permissive mode the rules are appalied to subject and object
but actions like Access denied. Logs and error messages  are generated based on selinux policies.)

  c)Disabled : we are turning of selinux to be diabled so logs cannot be generated.
 
  


To check the system is in which mode cmnd is : 

[root@linuxterminal ~]#getenforce
enforcing

To see the status of selinux :

[root@linuxterminal ~]#sestatus
SELinux status   : enabled
SELinux mount    :/selinux
current mode      :enforcing
mode from config file : enforcing
policyversion			:24
policy from configfile	:targeted

To set the value of selinux to permissive mode :

[root@linuxterminal ~]# setenforce 0 (1 is for enforcing mode ,0 is for permissive mode)
 
[root@linuxterminal ~]#sestatus
SELinux status   : enabled
SELinux mount    :/selinux
current mode      :permissive
mode from config file : enforcing
policyversion			:24
policy from configfile	:targeted

If it needs to works then we need to do :
[root@linuxterminal ~]#/etc/init.d/selinux restart ---->if it not works then we need to reboot the system to work.

To check the boolean values for FTP servers:

[root@linuxterminal ~]# getsebool -a |grep ftp
allow_ftpd_anon_write-->on         ------------>(if it is on then only will transfer the files from ftp server)
allow_ftpd_full_access-->off

To set the boolean values :
[root@linuxterminal ~]#setsebool allow_ftpd_anon_write off

[root@linuxterminal ~]# getsebool -a |grep ftp (it will turn off state)
allow_ftpd_anon_write-->off
allow_ftpd_full_access-->off

To check the SELinux context of file : and it is accessiable to the public from admin so that everyone can access.

[root@linuxterminal ~]# ls -Z filname



[root@linuxterminal ~]# ps -efZ | grep httpd 	 	


To change the context of a file :

To check --->[root@linuxterminal ~]#ls -ldz filename

To change [root@linuxterminal ~]# chcon  -t public_content_t filename

To check --->[root@linuxterminal ~]#ls -ldz filename

To restore-->[root@linuxterminal ~]#restorecon -v filename

To check --->[root@linuxterminal ~]#ls -ldz filename

SUDO : (substitue user do / super user do) :
--------------------------------------------
we can perform tasks same like as root user by the help of sudo command.

configuration file : cat /etc/sudoers  (root configuration for commands will be avaliable here.

--->To edit the sudoers file use (cmnd --->visudo) bacause it prevents to users login at same time and edit the file.

advantages :-

   1)we can restrict the users with the help of these file.
   2)the commands executed by sudo user will be stored under cat /var/log/secure
   3)we can create own log for sudo users by creating the file in /etc/sudoers At end give below command .
     --->   Defaults logfile=/etc/log/sudo.log
	 
	 
1)Allow normal user privelliage like root?
 
A) a)In visudo file under root add same previllages like root--->jagadeesh  ALL=(ALL)    ALL 
   b)But every time it will ask for password
   
   C)for seeting a normal user with out password in same file --->jagadeesh  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   
   Note but everytime we need to use sudo infort. --->sudo fdisk -l
   
2) Allow user to run one or two commands like root ?
   
A)  a)In visudo file under root add same previllages like root--->jagadeesh  ALL=(ALL)    sbin/fdisk,sbin/parted 
    b)so with this we will execute only two commands 
	
	Ex :[jagadeesh@server ~]$ sudo fdisk -l
	    [jagadeesh@server ~]$ sudo parted

3)Allow group to execute networking commands like root privelliage like root ?
 
A) a)uncomment the line cmnd_Allias Networking .

   b) And give---> %family  ALL=(ALL)  Networking
   
   And chek with group of people whether is working or not
   
4)How we can use customized commands to use users .
----------------------------------------------------------

to give permission for particular directory :--

oraasm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /asm01/app/19.0.0.0/grid/bin/crsctl

---------------------------------------------------------------------
A) go to visudo file ---->visudo 

 ## custom
 Cmnd_Alias CUSTOM =/sbin/service ,/bin/rpm  (Instead of giving comma , after every command we will use alias name and give more commands and use the alias name )
   
   %family ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD=CUSTOM
   
   
   
  
   
Cmnd_Alias  CMD_EXCLUDE= /bin/su - root,/bin/su - ,/bin/su root,/usr/bin/su root,/usr/bin/su - root,/bin/sudo -i, /usr/bin/vi /etc/sudoers, 
/usr/bin/vi /etc/sudoers.d/*, /sbin/visudo, /usr/bin/sudo -s, /usr/bin/passwd, /usr/bin/crontab -e, /usr/bin/crontab –l, /bin/umount, 
/bin/mount, /sbin/reboot, /sbin/init, /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/userdel, /sbin/usermod, /sbin/useradd, /usr/bin/vi /etc/shadow, /bin/passwd, 
/usr/bin/su -, /sbin/ifdown, /sbin/ifup, /bin/sh, /bin/bash, /bin/dash, /bin/tcsh, /bin/csh, /bin/ksh, /usr/bin/dzsh, /usr/local/bin/RootShell


Trouble shooting Steps :
-----------------------
1) If we have any error in /etc/sudoers (or) any files under /etc/sudoers.d 
  Then we will be  unable to swith root and we are not able to execute othe commands with---> sudo as well
  
Sol : need to login as root directly and check in the files which file we are getting error and comment that line.

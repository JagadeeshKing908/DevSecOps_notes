Filters :

1)Less:
  
  If we want to see opp line wise or page wise we use less commands.
   a)Next page we will use - d.
   b)previous page will use - b.
   c)To search use - /word
   d)To quit - q   
  
2)more :
  
  It is exactly the same as more command.
         a)Next page we will use - d.
		b)previous page will use - b.
		c)To search use - /word
		d)To quit - q 
3)head :
   It is going to display top 10 lines of the file by default. we can use them like how many lines we want.
   
   head -n /etc/passwd --->Here n means no of lines.
   
   
4)Tail :
  It is going to display bottom 10 lines of the file by default. we can use them like how many lines we want.
  
     tail -n /etc/passwd --->Here n means no of lines.
	 
	 If we want to see the current running logs then we will use -f.
	 
	 tail -f /var/log/messages
	 
5)Sort :

     It is used to see the output in alphabetical or numerical order.
	 
6)Cut :

     If we want to extract some column in file then we will use cut filter.
	 
	  cut -d : -f1 /etc/passwd > output.txt
	  
	  d : delimeter .. Is nothing but comma's , semicollan ,collan
	 -f1:first column
	 
	 If we use (>)grater than symbol with file name then will be redirected to that file.
	 
	 
7)Sed :

    It stands for stream editor.
	
	sed 's/max/john/g' /etc/passwd
	
	Here s : stands for search.
	     max : what name we are replacing.
		 john : it stands for what name we are replacing.
		 g : It stands for replacing.
		 
To print 5-9lines----->sed -n '5,9p' filename
 
    -n  -->supress automatic printing
	p -->print
	
	awk "NR >= 5 && NR ,=9 ' file.txt
	NR-->line number
	
	
To select columns -->awk

  $0 -->whole line
  $1 -->first column
  $2 -->second column
  
  awk '{print $2}' filename.txt
  awk '{print $1 ,$3}' filename
  	awk "NR == 5 || NR ==9 {print $1, $2}' file.txt
	
8)find:

     To find anything from under root we will use find command.
	 
syntax : find /underroot -option filename.

       / - we are searching it under root directory file or directory
	   
 -name : It is used search a file with its name.
 -inum : for searching a file with particular inode number.
 -type : for searching a particular type of file.
 -user : for searching a file with respect to its user.
 -group: for searching a file which belongs to particular group.
 
 
 -user :
 
  find / -user max

 -group :
	   find / -group max
	   
	 
9)Locate:

    It is also work same as find command.
	
syntax : locate filename.
	
	Some time it will show some wrong directories as well.


Trouble shooting :

 If we deleted a file and after the deletion of file in file system if it not be able to create any file in file system this is because of
 inode problem.To over come that follow the below.
 
 for searching file :---> find . -inum 148669 -exec {} \; 
 for removing file : ---> find . -inum 148669 -exec rm -i {} \; 
 
 If we want to remove same type of files in any directory we use find command.
 
 --->find / -type f -name "*.log" -exec ls -ltrh {} \;
 ---> to remove : find / -type f -name "*.log" -exec rm -rf {} \; 
 
 
 Here 
     exec : executing
 
     {}
		  This placeholder is used to represent the current file found by the find command.
		  When find locates a file that matches the criteria, it substitutes {} with the path of that file when executing the command specified by -exec.
     \;  
           This sequence indicates the end of the command that follows -exec. The backslash (\) is used to escape the semicolon (;) 
		   so that it is interpreted correctly by the shell rather than by the find command. This tells find that the command has concluded, 
		   and it can move on to the next file.

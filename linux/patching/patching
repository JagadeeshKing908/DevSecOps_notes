In patching it is not only update the packages it will clean all unwanted packages and install new packages and upgrade all packages .

* To check all the packages that is installed ----->rpm -qa (or) yum list installed
* To check the OS release ------>cat /etc/os-release 
*From where we are downloading the packages is cat /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat -rhui
• For checking what all the packages need to be installed in update ------>yum check-update (or)  yum list updates
• Need to check kernal version ----->uname -r
. For checking system is upto date -------->yum repolist 
• To update the packages ---------->yum update 
 • To check the kernel version ----->yum check-update 
 • And do reboot the the system ---> reboot
 • Check the packages again with ---->yum check-update
 • if it shows kernal version we need to install again else we are done
 • To check the kernel module file generated or not if it generated there is no kernal panic---->ls /lib/modules/current module name/modules.dep
 • rpm -qa --last | grep -i kernal

Pre checks: 

*Mount all mount points -----> mount -a
• And take the back-up of it -------->df -hTP >> /home/mount _points
• And take the back-up of host files --->cat /etc/hosts >> /home/hosts_backups

Post checks:

*Check the kernel version ---> uname -r

*With the help of diff command will validate the past back and new files
Ex : diff  /etc/hosts_bkp  /etc/hosts

If any difference it will show else not shows

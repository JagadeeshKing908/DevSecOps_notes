Logical volume management (LVM):

With the help of this logical management we can reduce and increase the size of logical volume.

Architecture :

physical volume --->volume group --->logical volume.

/dev/sdd     -->     VG001       --->lv001

Physical extent :

Extent is the block  the is used to store the data -->default size =4mib for RHEL6 --->pvdisplay--->cmnd
 
physical volume :

Set of extents is called the physical volume.

Volume Group:
volume group is same as physical volume.

Logical Volume:
------------
Splitting of volume group into multiple logical volumes we call it as logical group

Logical Extent:

Extent is the block  the is used to store the data.

Network confuguration and trouble shooting :-
-------------------------------------------

Networking :-

The communication between two systems(.i.e.,ip's) we call it as a network.

The basic requirements for network are 

1)NIC

2)media

3)Topology 

4)protocol

5)IP address

6)Gateway /Router

*** for One computer we can have only one(unique) MAC address ***************

1)NIC:
------
NIC (nic card i.e . they are eth0 ,eth1 ,eth2 different interfaces if one interface down other will be up)
we need to give bonding for that.

2)media:
--------
It means medium is the one it specifies that how we are going to connect to the internet (i.e. rj45 cable,wireless ...)

3)Topology :(How the systems are connected)
------------
It will be a bus topology or star or etc any thing for troubleshooting.

4)protocol :( TCP or UDP)
-----------
It is set of rules which has been in one machine to communicate with other machine.

TCP: (Transmission control protocol )

It is a connection oriented like wires.
If we are connected via lan cable the TCP works .
less data loss.
If we send 100 packets of data there will 100 packets recieved to other.
In tcp the connection will be slow . Here per every packet there will be a ackonowledgement from other layers as well (i.e. OSI)
the protocol no for TCP is 6

Eg:-FTP, SMTP, TCP,HTTP  (realtime eg...recordings like serials etc..)

UDP : (User datagram protocol)

It is connection less.
like what we are using.
Here we have data loss.
If we send 100 packets of data there will approx 80 packets recieved to other
In UDp the connection will be high i.e fast
the protocol no for TCP is 17
the protocol no for ICMP is 1

EG: DNS ,DHCP etc..(real time : live cricket matches ..etc..

5)IP address : This is the unique identification for communication between two systems.
-------------

for public network mostly will start with 192. rest will be private 

6)Gateway :(it is like visa when goes for other country we need visa for that county)
------------
It network point that provides entance to other network.it provides security to oragnasition (Router : It is a divice which  routes network)


All The network related information will be present in directory----------> cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts


for creating a new ethernet---->cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts and create file---->vi filename

And restart it by ---/etc/init.d/network restart (or) service network restart , service network stop , service network start

To change host name (cat /etc/sysconfig/network and change the hostname over there)

--------------->IN ifconfig -----
inet addr-(192.168.222.128)
It is ip address of system.
Bcast:-192.168.222.225
It refers to a special ip address that is used to send a message or packet to all devices on the network. Broadcast address are commonly used for network.
management tasks.such as sending out configuration updates or discovery requests.

Loop back address:-
If we want to see the operating system networking is working or not there we will check with loop back address.
With this we can check local network.


Ethernet configuration :

------>[root@localhost ~]# cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

configurirng of eth1 :

----->vi ifcfg-eth1

DEVICE="eth1"
BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
HWADDR="00:0C:29:9E:93:90"
IPV6INIT="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
TYPE="Ethernet"

--wq!

restart the network by using -->

1)/etc/init.d ifcfg-eth1 restart
2)service network restart.


2)/etc/sysconfig/network----->this file will keep the information about the hostname and information about the system. To change the hostname permanatly

vi /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORK="yes"
HOSTNAME="virtualterminal"


3)If we want to communicate with other hosts with same network range or differnet network range we want to map it host with ip to host and host to ip

If we want to resolve ip to hostname and host name to ip we need to map.
---->cat>>/etc/hosts
192.168.222.238  virtualmachine

when we need to see ip to hostname and hostname to we need to use dig command--> dig hostname , dig -x hostname

we can jump from cli to GUI for configurirng of network setting by using command ---->setup ,system-config-network

RUNLEVELS :

for checking of run levels we will use the command ---->chkconfig --list network  

for checking of what runlevel the system is booting up ---> runlevel

for checking of system runlevels -------->cat /etc/inittab

for checking of particular nic card is working or not ----->ethtool eth0 ---->in this if the link detected it shows no then the link is down .

PORTS:

To check the what ports are using what we use command----->netstat -anp |grep (port no or app name or service name)

ssh configuration file------> cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config---There we need to change the connector port.

Q)how do change the connection procees of particular port.
Ans)for every appalication or service we have dedicated configuration file we need to go there and we need to change the connector port.


IP address Explanation:-->xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx i.e (
It is divided into 5 i.e.(class A,B,C,D---multicast, E--->experimental and research)

Class A :
---Range is(0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255)
---It supports 16 million hosts.Large networks
class B:
---Range is(128.0.0.0 to 128.255.255.255)
---It supports 65000 hosts.medium sized networks (eg:companies etc
class c:
---Range is(192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)
---It supports 254 hosts.small sized networks(eg :home networks ..)
class D:
---Range is(224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
---It supports 254 hosts.small sized networks(Eg :multicast address group ..)
class E:
---Range is(224.0.0.0 to 254.255.255.255)
---It supports 254 hosts.small sized networks(eg :used for future and research ..)

FTP (File transfer protocol):- (Port :20,21)
-------------------------------

Downloading of content or uploading of content from one server(local machine) to other server(remote machine) we call it is as 
file transfer protocol.It use tcp .(ftp is used for uploading and downloading the files)

Disadvantages : directories can't be uploaded or downloaded
-------------

package :vsftpd

daemon :vsftpd( very secure ftp daemon)

script :/etc/initd/vsftpd

configuration files :
    /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
	/etc/vsftpd/user_list
	/etc/vsftpd/ftpuser
	/etc/pam.d/vsftpd
	
Document root : /var/ftp

home directory :/var/ftp
  

i.e. local machine <----------> Remote machine 
             20
-------   -------->       --------
client |      21           | server  |
-------    <---------      ---------   

port 20 : It is used to establish the connection between the client and the server.  (command control)
port 21  :It is used establish the data connection between the client and server.(data connection) 

There are two types of FTP :

1)Active mode ftp :
When we are going to downloading  something on internet active connection will happen. If exits both then active.
             20
-------   -------->       --------
client |       21          | server  |
-------    <---------     --------- 


2)passive mode ftp :

When we are going to   upload something on internet then passive connection will happen.if exits only one .
             20
-------   -------->       --------
client |      21          | server  |
-------   -------->       --------- 


CONFIGURING FTP SERVER :-
-----------------------
8---->  1)install vsftpd.
        2)vsftpd allows only anynomous users to login by default.To allow authinicated users to login .edit /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
          local.enable=yes
6-
for Uploading a file.

1)check whether the firewall is off or not for connection of another system.(systems are in same configuration)
2)check that system is installed with vsftpd . systemctl status vsftpd ; systemctl start vsftpd
3)And check what are run levels it is configured with and mark all run levels are on .------>systemctl enable vsftpd 
     Rhel6---->chkconfig --list  vsftpd
	     ------>chkconfig  --level 0123456 vsftpd on
		 
4)and go to cd /var/pub ---And here create some files

5)and check that in ftp server whether it is working or not 

6)cd /data --->create one directory /

7) jump to directory cd /var/ftp/pub/ --->give cd - (for this we need to switch the path where we are going to download the files first then we need to get the files after switching this path)

8)after jump to ftp by using --->ftp servername

9)  get filename to download.

and download it by using---> get filename 
    for downloading multiple files --->mget file1 file2 file3

for downloading a files:
    1)create a dierctory upload. and create some files in cd /data --touch file1.txt
	2)Change group permission of directory to ftp.----chgrp ftp
	3)and give full pemission to directory chmod 777 upload.
	4)IN configuration file we need to enable the anonymous_upload_enable=yes
	5)restart the service vsftpd.
	6)allow selinux to-->ftp anon_write on---->setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write on.
	7)we need to do rw permissions to ditectory we need to change it to admin by default is is public. ls -ldz
	 ----->chcon -t public_content_rw_t upload.
	 
FTP part :
   
     1)ftp localhost
	 2)username &passwd =ftp
	 3)and now it will be mounted on /root we need to change it upload -->cd /upload.
	 4)To list the files !ls 
	 5)To upload -->put file1.txt
	 6)for comming out--->bye
	 7)check go to upload and ---ls
	 
	 
Client configuration :
     1)check ip -->and ping same machine and server machine.
	 2)we need to copy and paste the server and client machines ip's to resolve each other in ---->cat /etc/hosts <---------- and paste same in ftp server
	 3)install ftp.
	 4)And connect with ftp server---->ftp serverip
	 5)cd /upload and --->!ls
	 6)put any file from that ---->put filename.
	 
	 7)check in server--->cd /var/ftp/upload ;ll

     Download :
	 1)ftp ip  and login.
	 2)!ls
	 3)cd /pub ;ls
	 4)get filename.
	 5)bye
	 
	 6)check cd / ;ls ---->check whether the file is there are not.
	 
	 


Trouble shooting :--

if it shows not logged login unsuccessfull  then we need stop ,disabel and start the vsftpd service.
route not found meand we need to add the ip and server name in cat /etc/hosts

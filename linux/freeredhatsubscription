How to Register RHEL for Free Developer Subscription :
-----------------------------------------------------
Login with Details --->https://developers.redhat.com
Register the system by running--->sudo subscription-manager register
Attach your free developer subscription---->sudo subscription-manager attach --auto


Q)how many days can i use and how many machines any pricess if we use ?

A)1-year subscription, renew free every year. Up to 16 machines (physical or virtual)

If you forget to renew your free RHEL developer subscription after a year, you won’t get charged, and your installed RHEL system will continue working.
The only difference is that you’ll lose access to official updates, patches, and subscription-based services until you renew.

install mailx and postfix on server

What Is mailx? (Mail User Agent – MUA)
mailx = Mail sending command / Email client

mailx provides the mail command, which lets YOU send mail from the terminal or scripts.

✔ Command-line tool to compose/send emails
✔ Used in automation scripts
✔ Used to test mail delivery
✔ Works on top of Postfix


Postfix = Mail Server / Mail Delivery Engine

Postfix is responsible for sending the email OUT from your Linux server.

✔ Sends emails to Gmail, Outlook, SMTP servers
✔ Handles queueing, retries, authentication
✔ Encrypts mail using TLS
✔ Receives mail (if configured)

Think of Postfix as the “delivery boy” who actually takes the letter and delivers it.

Pre-checks :-
-----------

1) - Check DNS resolution  ---> nslookup smtp.gmail.com
2) - Check connectivity using telnet --> telnet smtp.gmail.com 587 25 2525 465
3) - Check connectivity using nc  --> Need to install nmap-ncat, but only that:
     a) yum install -y nmap-ncat
     b) nc -v smtp.gmail.com 587


Installing and configuring part:-
---------------------------------
✅ Step-1 :— yum install -y mailx postfix

✅ Step-2 :— vim /etc/postfix/main.cf ( In our current org they are defining only inet_protocols and relay host rest are already defined)

inet_protocols = ipv4
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587

smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous

✅ Step-3 :— Create your Gmail password file

sudo vi /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
chmod 600 /etcpostfix/sasl_passwd

[smtp.gmail.com]:587 jagadeeshyeddula90888@gmail.com:xrzpfqbftsjtukml

YOUR_APP_PASSWORD :-- generate from the below link ( if it is gmail for my personal use if it is for company not required)

https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

✅ Step-4 :—

sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd (here we will get some duplicates comment them )

sudo systemctl restart postfix
echo "Gmail SMTP working!" | mail -s "Test Email" jagadeeshyeddula90888@gmail.com

✅ Step-5 :— To delete previous mails
   postqueue -f

METHOD 1 (RECOMMENDED): Delete ALL queued mails

Use this after fixing SMTP issues.

postsuper -d ALL

✅ METHOD 2: Delete a SPECIFIC mail (best practice)

If you want to delete only one mail:

postsuper -d 5ECC3A43E3


(Replace with actual Queue ID)

✅ METHOD 3: Delete ALL deferred mails only
postsuper -d ALL deferred

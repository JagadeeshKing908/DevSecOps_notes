System and demon Process :
-------------------------
Process : It is a program running in the linux system it also know as service or demon.

1)interactive processes :

 These are process created by user.
 eg : we are installing and running.
 
2)system process or demon :
 
 These are background process when a syetem is installed it will be genertaed automatically.

3)Automatic or batch :
  batch procees these are execueted when we are are scheduling the process at set of time .
  
  EG :cronjobs.
  
  
Child and parent process : Every process have a child wrt that parent process running for the same .except for init process.
-------------------------
When ever we are running a process that process we can have main process called child process and another parent process.
if we need to stop then we need to kill both the process.


ps -a --->is used to know the present running process on the system.

ps -u username ---It will show list of process with username.

ps -x

ps -aux

Signals :
--------
kill -l ---->will show the list of processes.


If your system uses systemd, chkconfig is not available. Instead, you can use:


List of running services at differnet runlevels :
-------------------------------------------------

systemctl list-unit-files --type=service     ---> It will show list of processing running
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running ---------->It will show list of processing running 

Niceness value /nice values :
------------------------------
 1)CPU will execute a process.
 2)The range of nice value is -20 t0 19.
 3)if the vale is -20 is high priority. If it is 19 it is lowest prority.
 4)we have two commands to set one is --->nice and renice
 
 
To set :
-------
nice -n -5 cat > file4.txt
It will run as we give the time limit 

To check with process id in other terminal it will show---->ps -elf 

To change the process execution :
-----------------------------
renice 5 pid

to check --->ps -elf
